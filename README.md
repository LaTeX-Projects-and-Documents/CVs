# CVs
Although this may seem like a shameless plug, my CVs were written in LaTeX. As such, I feel it is appropriate to showcase my skills in writing in LaTeX with these documents. I felt that LaTeX would give me the most control over the document and it allowed me to write out my CV in my vision. I am pleased with the overall result.
As can be seen, I have a traditional CV and an academic CV here.
